# Prior and Posterior of Beta Distribution for response rate {.smaller}
    
-   Conjugate Prior \pi is $f(\pi)$, where $\pi \sim {Beta(\alpha, \beta)}$,
    same family of distribution of Posterior (see below)
-   We know the mean response rate (RR) is :
    $$\pi = \ \frac {\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$$
-   Likelihood is $f(x|\pi)$, where $x \sim {Binomial(x, n)}$

-   The updated Posterior $f( \pi | x )$ is again a $Beta$ distribution (same family as
    prior) : $$ \pi| \ x \sim Beta(\alpha + x, \ \beta + n - x)$$ where $x$ is
    the number of responders of current trials

## Updating the Posterior{.smaller}
<!-- - The updated Posterior will have the parameters $\alpha + x$ and -->
<!-- $\beta + n - x$.   -->
<!-- - With the prior of $Beta(0.6, 0.4)$ and the result of our interim results our Posterior has these parameters:  \ $Beta(16.6, 7.4)$.  -->
- Using the formula for the mean, where  $\alpha = 0.6, \beta = 0.4$ and at interim x = 16, n = 23 :
 $$ \pi = \ \frac {\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} = \ \frac {\alpha_{updated} }{\alpha_{updated} + \beta_{updated}} = \ \frac {16.6 }{16.6 + 7.4} ≈ 69.17 \% $$
 
  $$ mode (\pi) = \ \frac {\alpha_{updated} -1 }{\alpha_{updated} + \beta_{updated} - 2} = \ \frac {16.6 -1  }{16.6 + 7.4 - 2} ≈ 70.90 \% $$

## Terminology

- A "look" is a stop
- A stop is when a rule is applied
- The rule is specified for Go, Stop or Evaluate (Gray zone)
- If the rule is met, the result is Go, Stop or Evaluate (Gray zone)
- Rules are applied at interim or final 
- Go = Success = Efficacious
- Stop = Failure = Futile
- Rule = Criteria, e.g. Go rule is a Go Criteria

## Beta prior mixture{.smaller}

<!-- {\displaystyle {\frac {\alpha -1}{\alpha +\beta -2}}\!}  -->

- `phase1b` facilitates the flexibility of usingvarious priors and its respective weightings:

                 Prior is P_E ~ sum(weights * beta(parE[, 1], parE[, 2]))

```{r, echo = TRUE, results='hide'}
a = postprob(x = 16,
             n = 23,
             p = 0.60,
             parE = c(0.6, 0.4), weights = 1)

b = postprob(x = 16,
             n = 23,
             p = 0.60,
             parE = c(2, 4), weights = 1)

0.5*(a + b)

postprob(x = 16,
             n = 23,
             p = 0.60,
             parE = rbind(c(0.6, 0.4), c(2, 4)), weights = c(0.5, 0.5))
```


- Posterior formulation :

$$  f(\pi | x)  \propto \  \pi^{x} (1-\pi)^{n-x}\sum_{j = 1}^{k} \ w_j \frac {1}{B(\alpha_j, \beta_j)} \pi^{\alpha_j-1}(1-\pi)^{\beta_j-1}

- Futility criteria, eg. we would stop for Futility if :

`Pr( RR < p0) > tL`

## Rules and Operating characteristics. A use case for `ocPostprob()`: {.smaller}
-   Look for Efficacy: Go if $P( \pi > 60\% | \ data ) > 90 \%$

# Backupslides

## Standard of Care Distribution when unknown
Using the approach by Thall and Simon (Biometrics, 1994), this evaluates the
posterior probability of achieving superior response rate in the treatment group `E`
compared to standard of care `S`. 

- The desired improvement is denoted as `delta`. There are two options in using `delta`.
The absolute case when `relativeDelta = FALSE` and relative as when `relativeDelta = TRUE`.


# Desired improvement `delta`, two approaches:{.smaller}

 1. The absolute case is when we define an absolute delta, greater than `P_S`,
the response rate of the standard of care or control or `S` group such that
the posterior is `Pr(P_E > P_S + delta | data)`.

 2. In the relative case, we suppose that the treatment group's
response rate is assumed to be greater than `P_S + (1-P_S) * delta` such that
the posterior is `Pr(P_E > P_S + (1 - P_S) * delta | data)`.

User facing functions with this feature include


- `postprobDist()`
- `predprobDist`
- `ocPostprobDist()`
- `ocPredprobDist()`
 
## Does CDF improve with increased "data availability" of priors ?

Here we have an interim result of 16 and 23 patients. (input for Likelihood)

We have a threshold of 60% success. Our standard of care is 60%. Our priors have a mean of 50%.

## Does CDF improve with increased "data availability" of priors ?

No.

## Predictive posterior probability for Decision 1 :{.smaller} 


The criteria for Decision 1 for Interim looks are :

- interim GO : `P( success at final) > phiU`

- interim STOP : `P( success at final) < phiL`

The criteria for Decision 1 for Final looks are:

- Final GO : `P( response rate > p0 | data) > tT`

- Final STOP : `P( response rate > p0 | data ) < tT`

## Predictive posterior probability for Decision 2:{.smaller} 


The criteria for Decision 2 for Interim looks are :

- Interim GO : `P ( success at final) > phiU`

- Interim STOP : `P (failure at final ) > phiFu`

 The criteria for Decision 2 for Futility looks are :
 
 - Final GO : `P( response rate > p0) > tT`
 
 - Final STOP : `P( response rate  < p1) > tF`
