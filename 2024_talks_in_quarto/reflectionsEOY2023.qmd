## Background 1 of 2

-   Onboarding start \~ June 2023

-   Current duration of rotation \~7 months

-   standup meeting daily + 1 month "break" + second or third daily

-   9 PRs, of which 7 were large üòÖ

-   refactoring `phase1b` which is already available internally and "complete"

## Background 2 of 2

New skills are many and I am still learning them :

-   git kraken and branching

-   pre-commit checks

-   documentation, building documents and reviewing them

-   taking a reviewer perspective

-   new packages I used : roxygen, styler, prettier, testthat, checkmate ...

## Features of Statistical Software Engineering 1 of 2

My reflections on what characterizes this kind of work:

-   Lots of moving parts

-   Collaborative : Forest vs Trees perspective applies all the time

-   Requires focussed and deep thinking

-   Small steps are good starts

-   Systematic deduction is helpful

-   Lots of theory and reading literature about new methodology

-   Good engineering practices are like habits, needs automation which needs practice which needs time

## Features of Statistical Software Engineering 1 of 2

My reflections on what characterizes this kind of work:

-   Small PRs can be sizable in work too

-   Regular standups can feel pressured, but in the end I am glad they are bunched up together as long as expectations are managed

-   Work can be creative, but once foundation is there

-   It's fun!

    Good stand ups have acknowledged the nature of the work

## What I learned in the 1 month of no standups

-   Standups are helpful

-   Develop systematic deduction

-   Fall on the engineering principles (testing, debugging, iteration, reliability, correctness...)

-   Think creatively of other solutions by myself

## Collaboration for `phase1b` work

-   Positive bias & Trust

-   Learning through mistakes is key

-   Collaboration works best when the features of this kind of work is accounted for

-   Safe space to be ask any questions and iterate

## What has worked well in standups and `phase1b` work 1 of 2

-   Daniel is proactive in reaching out and allocating time to do standups, e.g. increasing frequency

-   Daniel is responsive to helping and is patient e.g. google hangouts to help unblock steps. Feedback turnover is quick and with example and rationale, then I can remember where exactly

-   PR has "conversations" and Daniel actually gives feedback on it

-   Being allowed to do the work, make mistakes, talk about theory

## What has worked well in standups and `phase1b` work 2 of 2

-   Systematic deduction together, so I can see what kind of habits an expert has

-   Making an effort to teach again without resentment

-   Encouraging to go for presentations internally and externally as good milestones to develop further

-   Positive feedback but No over positiveness

-   there's more...

## What I'm changing after learning about this kind of work

-   Create more conditions for focused, systematic, deep and creative work

-   Approach work slower because in the end there has been efficiency gains

-   Perceive small steps as good starts

-   This is not overnight work, but slow and sustained good practices with an open mind

## Future outlook

-   Smaller PRs ‚òëÔ∏è

-   Standup formats are valuable, 1-2-3 times per week if needed

-   Understand my strengths better as this is a new field

-   Making a cool HEX sticker and Logo for `phase1b`

-   Internal Presentation (other than Basel Biostats ?) and External ‚òëÔ∏è

-   Working on refactoring other packages
