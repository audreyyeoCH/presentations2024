                                             and opportunities 
                                                       (Joo et al, 2022)

# On Florance Nightingale:
<!-- ‚ÄúThe very first requirement in a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm.‚Äù -->
```
"Their principle, if logically carried out, is simply to throw out all ages and all diseases and then there would be no mortality whatever."
```

# Why we need Diversity in Statistics
```
Because we need to keep solving the world's most urgent problems in 

Medicine, Climatology, Sociology ... we need everyone onboard :

                  
                  Ronald, John, Bruno, Carlo, David and more ...
