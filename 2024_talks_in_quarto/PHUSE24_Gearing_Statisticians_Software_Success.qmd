# Why Software Engineering ?{.smaller}

**Why find solutions when we can also build them ?**

-   Mathematics is Elegant

-   Building software can be inclusive and collaborative

-   I can create delightful experiences users and bring everyone along : *values of inclusion, building great products, having an impact*

## Why Software Engineering : A response to dynamic decision making in early development {.smaller}

## Skills needed : Covering the basics {.smaller}

-   Onboarding June + July 2023
    -   R basics: coding and style
    -   Good function writing in R
    -   R debugging
    -   R advanced: package development
        -   Basics of Package Development in R
        -   `roxygen2` introduction another resource
        -   Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages

***in summary, gaps were*** : Git merging, Pull Requests, Styling, Debugging, Writing Tests

## New beginnings :{.smaller} 
Knowledge and skills for Statistical Software Engineering!

-   Visualing branches : `Git kraken`, `VS Code Git Graph Extension`
-   Checking : `pre-commit`, `Git hub checks`, `R CMD`
-   Documentation : Writing (`roxygen2`), building, reviewing documentation
-   Testing : Taking a reviewer perspective (`testthat` and `checkmate`)
-   Styling : `styler`, `prettier` ... building your own style

# What is refactoring ?{.smaller}

-   "Polishing an antique cup", making new of "vintage".

```{r, out.height = 350, out.width = 500, fig.align = 'center'}
#| fig-alt: "see sub cap"
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "Peranakan bowl from Late 19-20th Century, Kuala Lumpur, British Malaya"
knitr::include_graphics("images/Peranakan_bowl.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

## Tools for refactoring{.smaller}

```{r}
#| fig-alt: "see sub cap"
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-cap: 
#| - "Roxygen skeleton example for one user-facing function in phase1b"
knitr::include_graphics("images/typed_asserts.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Tools for refactoring{.smaller}

-   Variables are `typed` defined from package `roxygen2` and it's type asserted from package `checkmate`
-   Unit and integration testing takes on the perspective of a reviewer and to ensure the function calls calculates what it says it calculates (they are my favourite). Package `testthat` and `checkmate` are used here
-   Making `phase1b` a State of Art Software[^2] - reproducible, robust, testable, intuitive and open to collaboration

[^2]: Subject to a change in definition with better tools and practices

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(roxygen2)
library(devtools)
roxygen2::roxygenise() # converts roxygen comments to .Rd files
devtools::document()  # R converts .Rd files to human readable documentation
# then Ctrl + Shift + D, if you’re using RStudio.
```

## What is debugging ?

*To find a needle in the haystack systematically*

-   Takes the most time and is the most difficult
-   Needs a lot more courage than creativity
-   Maintains humility

*embrace small steps as smaller PRs can be sizeABLE.*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# | echo = false
# | eval = false
debugonce()
debug()
undebug()
options(error = recover)
options(error = NULL)
```

## Polishin' the vintage function - A checklist approach {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/Example_checklist.png)
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

1.  One Design Document for entire function

2.  One issue is the smallest task from (1)

3.  One issue to one branch

4.  One issue to one Pull Request (PR)

5.  Create Test files for helper functions

6.  Create Test files and example files for main function calls

## The Design Document{.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Design_doc_ocPost.png")
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
User-facing functions start with Design-document 

1. Helps achieve Clarity on the form and purpose of the user-facing function

2. Test regular and edge cases 

3. Makes the rest of the work "easier" when the goals are clear

4. Most of the "skeleton" and "flesh" of the work can already be done in the because of 1-3

## Features of Statistical Software Engineering {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Moving parts, collaboration is must
-   Alignment of Forest vs Trees perspective
-   Requires focused and deep thinking
-   Small steps are good starts e.g. small PRs
-   Creative work comes after foundation
<!-- The Fundamentals ISE Playbook -->
<!-- We consider code to be incomplete if it is not accompanied by tests -->
<!-- We write unit tests (tests without external dependencies) that can run before every PR merge to validate that we don’t have regressions -->
<!-- We write Integration tests/E2E tests that test the whole system end to end, and run them regularly -->
<!-- We write our tests early and block any further code merging if tests fail. -->
<!-- We run load tests/performance tests where appropriate to validate that the system performs under stress -->
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Systematic deduction is key to debugging
-   Lots of theory and reading literature about new methodology
-   Good engineering practices are habits, needs automation which needs practice which needs time
:::
:::

## Good practices for new starter {.smaller}

Goal : introduce good practices and improve muscle memory and collaborate

-   Mindset : Being dependent on others is normal. Asking questions are key because there are also many moving parts. Group chats are valuable in a safe space to ask questions.
-   Regular stand ups
-   Taking Small steps : are good starts
-   Taking Systematic steps : no matter how slow
    -   e.g. `debug()`, `undebug()`, `options(recover = error)`, `options(recover = NULL)`
-   older PRs are helpful to learn and reflect

## Good practices for the Engineering Lead {.smaller}

Goal : introduce good practices and improve muscle memory and collaborate

-   Patience
-   Quick turnover for feedback
-   Positive feedback but no over positiveness, always based on facts
-   Use chats in PR can be helpful to precise the feedback
-   Demonstrate small and systematic deduction during debugging
-   Acknowledge learning styles can be different
-   Allow developers to do the work, make mistakes and keep sharing rationale

## Conditions for success from the `phase1b` work

\

-   Positive bias & Trust are win-win situations

-   Learning through mistakes is key

-   Safe space to be ask any questions, and iterate, even for a seasoned engineer

## Kinds of feedback

\

-   "Great motivation to learn new skills"

-   "... it was always fun and easy to work with Audrey"

## How I want to be a better Software Engineer {.smaller}

-   Develop the skills of slow and systematic deduction (efficiency gains)
-   Create more conditions for focused, systematic, deep and creative work
-   Perceive small steps as good starts
-   Continue having an open mind on what good practices are
-   Be more patient with the process
-   Fall on the engineering principles (testing, debugging, iteration, reliability, correctness...)

## Future outlook

\

-   Go through several more issues to complete and make it more delightful

-   submission to CRAN

-   Collaborate by contacting [me](email%20:%20comptesaudrey@gmail.com)

***More software work for statisticians with values of : Inclusion, Diversity, Impact and Delightful user experience***

## Final Reflections{.smaller}

-   I started off as a Clinical Trial Statistician (with good technical skills) but doing something I wasn't prepared to do paid off
-   There were new skills to gain, but it was always Confidence through Competence
-   Can use this as a reference to build other packages and in other languages [e.g. Julia, see my blog post](https://audreyyeoch.github.io/Julia.html)
<!-- -   Less likely to doubt myself when I learn new things, and I believe the recent `phase1b` journey is a testiment to those who find themselves in this situation. -->

As in Statistics, no matter how much you've improved it's not permanent
