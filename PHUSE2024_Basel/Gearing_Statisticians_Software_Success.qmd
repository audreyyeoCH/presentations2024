## `phase1b` package history

-   2015 : Started as a need in Roche's early development group, package development led by Daniel SabanÃ©s BovÃ© in 2015.

-   2023 : Refactoring, Renaming, adding Unit and Integration tests as current State-of-Art Software Engineering practice.

-   100% written in R and Open Source.

# Why Should Statisticians make Software ?
                             
                             ...why not ?
                             
## Clinical Trials Statisticians understand :{.smaller}

- Clinical development
- Roadblocks to end points e.g. recruitment rates and failures,
business assumptions and strategies
- Drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics e.g. latent drug effect
- Patient population e.g. rare diseases
- combined Science and Business perspectives
        
## My Journey at F. Hoffmann La-Roche{.smaller}

-   graduated MSc Biostatistics in 2020
-   started at RWD at Roche in mid 2021
-   joined R&D at Roche in mid 2022
-   first internal statistics presentation end 2022 on decision gating
    -   skills : R programming, writing functions, version control (GitLab, GitHub), presentation and communication
-   started `phase1b` in July 2023

# Why Software Engineering ?{.smaller}

**Why find solutions when we can also build them ?**

-   Mathematics is Elegant

-   Building software can be inclusive and collaborative

-   I can create delightful experiences users and bring everyone along : *values of inclusion, building great products, having an impact*

## Skills needed : Covering the basics {.smaller}

-   Onboarding June + July 2023
    -   R basics: coding and style
    -   Good function writing in R
    -   R debugging
    -   R advanced: package development
        -   Basics of Package Development in R
        -   Roxygen2 introduction another resource
        -   Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages

***in summary, gaps were*** : Git merging, Pull Requests, Styling, Debugging, Writing Tests

## New beginnings : 
Knowledge and skills for Statistical Software Engineering!

-   Visualing branches : `Git kraken`, `VS Code Git Graph Extension`
-   Checking : `pre-commit`, `Git hub checks`, `R CMD`
-   Documentation : Writing (`roxygen`), building, reviewing documentation
-   Testing : Taking a reviewer perspective (`testthat` and `checkmate`)
-   Styling : `styler`, `prettier` ... building your own style

# What is refactoring ?

-   "Polishing an antique cup", making new of "vintage".

```{r, out.height = 350, out.width = 500, fig.align = 'center'}
#| fig-alt: "see sub cap"
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "Peranakan bowl from Late 19-20th Century, Kuala Lumpur, British Malaya"
knitr::include_graphics("images/Peranakan_bowl.jpg", error = FALSE)
```

## Tools for refactoring

```{r}
#| fig-alt: "see sub cap"
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "Roxygen skeleton"
knitr::include_graphics("images/typed_asserts.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Tools for refactoring

-   Variables are `typed` defined from package `roxygen2` and it's type asserted from package `checkmate`
-   Unit and integration testing takes on the perspective of a reviewer and to ensure the function calls calculates what it says it calculates (they are my favourite). Package `testthat` and `checkmate` are used here
-   Making `phase1b` a State of Art Software[^1] - reproducible, robust, testable, intuitive and open to collaboration

[^1]: Subject to a change in definition with better tools and practices

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(roxygen2)
library(devtools)
roxygen2::roxygenise() # converts roxygen comments to .Rd files
devtools::document()  # R converts .Rd files to human readable documentation
# then Ctrl + Shift + D, if youâ€™re using RStudio.
```

## What is debugging ?

*To find a needle in the haystack systematically*

-   Takes the most time and is the most difficult
-   Needs a lot more courage than creativity
-   Maintains humility

*embrace small steps as smaller PRs can be sizeABLE.*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# | echo = false
# | eval = false
debugonce()
debug()
undebug()
options(error = recover)
options(error = NULL)
```

## Features of Statistical Software Engineering {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Moving parts, collaboration is must
-   Alignment of Forest vs Trees perspective
-   Requires focused and deep thinking
-   Small steps are good starts e.g. small PRs
-   Creative work comes after foundation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Systematic deduction is key to debugging
-   Lots of theory and reading literature about new methodology
-   Good engineering practices are habits, needs automation which needs practice which needs time
:::

## Good practices for new starter {.smaller}

Goal : introduce good practices and improve muscle memory and collaborate

-   Mindset : Being dependent on others is normal. Asking questions are ok because there are also many moving parts.
-   Regular stand ups
-   Taking Small steps : are good starts
-   Taking Systematic steps : no matter how slow
    -   e.g. `debug()`, `undebug()`, `options(recover = error)`, `options(recover = NULL)`
-   older PRs are helpful to learn and reflect

## Good practices for the Engineering Lead {.smaller}

Goal : introduce good practices and improve muscle memory and collaborate

-   Patience
-   Quick turnover for feedback
-   Positive feedback but no over positiveness, always based on facts
-   Use chats in PR can be helpful to precise the feedback
-   Demonstrate small and systematic deduction during debugging
-   Acknowledge learning styles can be different
-   Allow developers to do the work, make mistakes and keep sharing rationale

## Comments on collaboration for `phase1b` work

\

-   Positive bias & Trust are win-win situations

-   Learning through mistakes is key

-   Safe space to be ask any questions, and iterate, even for a seasoned engineer

## Kinds of feedback

\

-   "Great motivation to learn new skills"

-   "... it was always fun and easy to work with Audrey"

## How I want to be a better Software Engineer {.smaller}

-   Develop the skills of slow and systematic deduction (efficiency gains)
-   Create more conditions for focused, systematic, deep and creative work
-   Perceive small steps as good starts
-   Continue having an open mind on what good practices are
-   Be more patient with the process
-   Fall on the engineering principles (testing, debugging, iteration, reliability, correctness...)

## Future outlook

\

-   Go through several more issues to complete and make it more delightful

-   submission to CRAN

-   Collaborate by contacting [me](email%20:%20comptesaudrey@gmail.com)

***More software work for statisticians with values of : Inclusion, Diversity, Impact and Delightful user experience***

## Final Reflections

-   Doing something I wasn't prepared to do paid off
-   I got more confident about the R Language
-   Can use this as a reference to build other packages and in other languages [e.g. Julia, see my blog post](https://audreyyeoch.github.io/Julia.html)
-   Less likely to doubt myself when I learn new things

No matter how much you've improved it's not permanent
