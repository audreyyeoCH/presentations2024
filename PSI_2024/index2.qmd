# Prior and Posterior of Beta Distribution for response rate {.smaller}


    
-   Conjugate Prior \pi is $f(\pi)$, where $\pi \sim {Beta(\alpha, \beta)}$,
    same family of distribution of Posterior (see below)
-   We know the mean response rate (RR) is :
    $$\pi = \ \frac {\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$$
-   Likelihood is $f(x|\pi)$, where $x \sim {Binomial(x, n)}$

-   The updated Posterior $f( \pi | x )$ is again a $Beta$ distribution (same family as
    prior) : $$ \pi| \ x \sim Beta(\alpha + x, \ \beta + n - x)$$ where $x$ is
    the number of responders of current trials

# The benefit of a Bayesian approach is the possibility to account for prior data (Thall &amp; Simon,
# 1994) in that a new drug may have shown some signals of efficacy owing to its proposed
# mode of action, or similar activity based on prior data.

# History and how to install : {.smaller}

-   2015 : Started as a need in Roche's early development group, package development led by Daniel
    Sabanés Bové in 2015.

-   2023 : Refactoring, Renaming, adding Unit and Integration tests as current State-of-Art Software Engineering practice.

## Updating the Posterior and making a decision {.smaller}

- The updated Posterior will have the parameters $\alpha + x$ and
$\beta + n - x$.  
- With the prior of $Beta(0.6, 0.4)$ and the result of our interim results our Posterior has these parameters:  \ $Beta(16.6, 7.4)$
